# codecademy_Redux-Road
This is my solution to the Redux Road project. A text based project on Codecademy about Redux. 

Project Description: In this project, your objective is to create a text-based adventure game using reducers, state, and actions. The state will serve as a reflection of the game’s current status, encompassing elements such as the player’s inventory, distance covered, and time spent on the journey. Each occurrence within the game will be depicted as an action, allowing players to collect supplies, embark on travels, and occasionally, if they dare, encounter mishaps like overturning their wagon and losing their provisions.

By completing this project, you’ll practice your skills in:

- State management
- Redux usage pattern
- Immutable state updates
- Defining and using actions
